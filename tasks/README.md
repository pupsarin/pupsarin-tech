## Development Guidelines

### Task Format

Each task includes:

- **Priority**: High/Medium/Low
- **Estimated Time**: Development hours

- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific requirements for completion
- **Technical Notes**: Implementation details and considerations

### Getting Started

1. Review the main page tasks first (MapPage, AuthPage)
2. Implement core components (EventMap, TimeNavigator)
3. Set up state management (AuthStore, EventsStore)
4. Add supporting pages and features
5. Implement styling and responsive design

- **Routing**: Vue Router 4
- **Maps**: Leaflet.js
- **Styling**: CSS with CSS Variables
- **Build Tool**: Vite

### Mock Data

All features use mock data for development. Real API integration can be added later by replacing the mock implementations in the stores.
